# VD
Agenda : Get VD integrated with default phone app
Motive : 
          Help the people who are in the bussiness where they have to make regular calls from excel. User can just read the number and it will be dialled.
          Also help people with poor vision make the calls with least support
Future :
          Read the incoming call (if enabled) and tell the mobile device holder who is calling.
How is this better than existing apps:
          No adds.
          Feature to dial number which are not in phonebook
          Read the incoming call
          Connect to truecaller to identify unknown incoming call
